# This here is a small collection of `.ipynb` for playing with langchain and prompts
In the first cell of the ipynb I use the Groq api key.  
If you don't have this you need to go to groq.com and signup. It is free and they have many different models you can try out. 
When you have your key you need to change the str `<your key>` with your api key.  
After that you are set to go.  
Happy prompting.
